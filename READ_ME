## How It Works

1. The user opens the assistant and types a question (for example, "What’s the average home price in Austin?").  
2. The chatbot processes the query using natural language understanding.  
3. Data is retrieved from APIs and databases containing real-time housing data.  
4. The assistant delivers a clear, well-informed answer, often with visual or numerical insights.
